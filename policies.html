<!-- Overview -->
<section id="overview" class="content-section">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The Federal Reserved Accounts (FRA) platform provides this official policies page to establish transparency in
    our operations, data management, and digital governance. The FRA’s mission is to uphold integrity, accountability,
    and public confidence through clear policy communication and adherence to federal-level cybersecurity and privacy
    frameworks.</p>
  <p>These policies reflect our ongoing commitment to protecting personal information, ensuring equitable access to
    online resources, and maintaining high ethical standards in all user interactions. The FRA adheres to applicable
    laws and follows guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Federal Information
    Security Management Act (FISMA), and related frameworks governing data and systems security.</p>
  <p>All users are encouraged to read these policies carefully. Continued use of our services constitutes agreement
    with the terms and policies outlined herein. These guidelines evolve as technology and regulatory expectations
    advance, ensuring that we remain compliant, secure, and transparent.</p>
</section>

<!-- Privacy Policy -->
<section id="privacy" class="content-section">
  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We value and protect your privacy with utmost diligence. FRA collects only the information necessary for
    identity verification, fraud prevention, and communication related to official services. We do not sell, lease, or
    share your information with external entities for commercial gain.</p>
  <p>All personal data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, stored within systems governed by strict access
    controls. Internal reviews and automated compliance checks ensure privacy standards remain uncompromised.</p>
  <p>Users may request access to their stored data or submit a deletion request through verified contact channels.
    Data requests are processed according to regulatory and security protocols to prevent unauthorized disclosures.
    FRA retains certain information as required by law or for ongoing fraud investigation purposes.</p>
  <p>Cookies used on this platform are limited to essential session tracking and system security monitoring. We do
    not employ marketing or third-party analytics cookies that track personal behavior across external websites.</p>
</section>

<!-- Security Practices -->
<section id="security" class="content-section">
  <h2>Security Practices</h2>
  <p>Security is at the core of FRA’s mission. Our systems are continuously monitored, patched, and updated following
    recommendations from federal cybersecurity centers. The organization employs multi-layered defense mechanisms,
    intrusion detection systems, and zero-trust network models.</p>
  <p>All employees and contractors undergo annual cybersecurity awareness training and must adhere to the agency’s
    Acceptable Use Policy. Account credentials are protected using strong encryption and multi-factor authentication.
    Data centers hosting FRA’s services comply with federal authorization standards, ensuring infrastructure integrity.</p>
  <p>Users are advised to regularly update their passwords, monitor their account activities, and avoid using shared
    networks when accessing sensitive information. Suspicious activity should be reported immediately via the Report
    Fraud page.</p>
</section>

<!-- Data Retention & Access -->
<section id="data" class="content-section">
  <h2>Data Retention & Access</h2>
  <p>FRA maintains records for only as long as necessary to provide essential services, comply with legal
    requirements, and support legitimate investigations. Retention schedules follow federal archival standards and are
    reviewed annually by the compliance committee.</p>
  <p>All data access is logged, monitored, and restricted to authorized personnel. Each request for access must be
    justified, approved, and documented to ensure accountability. Automated systems perform periodic audits to
    identify anomalies or unauthorized retrievals.</p>
  <p>Users have the right to access their data, request corrections, or verify retention duration through official
    communication channels. Data integrity remains a top priority, with mechanisms to prevent tampering or corruption.</p>
</section>

<!-- Accessibility Commitment -->
<section id="accessibility" class="content-section">
  <h2>Accessibility Commitment</h2>
  <p>The FRA strives to ensure that all individuals, regardless of ability, have equal access to information and
    digital services. We follow Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA) and Section 508 of the
    Rehabilitation Act.</p>
  <p>Our accessibility initiatives include testing with assistive technologies, providing text alternatives for
    non-text content, ensuring logical navigation structures, and designing high-contrast, readable interfaces.</p>
  <p>We continuously monitor user feedback to improve inclusivity. If you encounter accessibility barriers, please
    contact us through the form provided on our website. Requests are prioritized and reviewed by our compliance team
    to ensure swift resolution.</p>
</section>

<!-- Policy Updates -->
<section id="updates" class="content-section">
  <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>FRA’s policy framework is dynamic and adaptive. Updates are made to reflect advancements in technology, emerging
    threats, and evolving legal mandates. Users are notified of significant changes via public announcements and
    update logs maintained on this page.</p>
  <p>Each revision undergoes internal legal review, stakeholder consultation, and compliance testing before
    implementation. Version history is retained for reference and auditing purposes.</p>
</section>

<!-- New Sections -->
<section id="encryption" class="content-section">
  <h2>Data Encryption & Cybersecurity Standards</h2>
  <p>All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256 standards, with cryptographic keys rotated and stored securely.
    Our cybersecurity posture follows a defense-in-depth model that includes endpoint protection, intrusion
    prevention, and advanced network segmentation to isolate threats.</p>
  <p>We collaborate with federal information security task forces to align with NIST SP 800-53 controls and maintain
    up-to-date security compliance audits. Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments are conducted to
    preempt risks.</p>
  <p>Incident response protocols are reviewed quarterly, ensuring readiness in detecting, mitigating, and reporting
    cyber incidents to relevant authorities.</p>
</section>

<section id="identity" class="content-section">
  <h2>Identity Verification & Compliance Standards</h2>
  <p>Identity verification processes ensure that all registered users are authenticated through secure channels.
    Verification includes multi-step validation of submitted credentials, digital signatures, and IP activity
    correlation to prevent fraudulent access.</p>
  <p>FRA complies with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) principles where applicable. These
    standards safeguard both the institution and the public from misuse of federal services.</p>
</section>

<section id="records" class="content-section">
  <h2>Records Retention Policy</h2>
  <p>All official communications, system logs, and transaction data are archived under controlled storage for a
    defined period. Access logs are preserved for auditing and forensic examination in the event of an investigation.
    Records not deemed necessary are systematically purged following federal records disposal guidelines.</p>
  <p>Backups are encrypted and geographically distributed to ensure disaster recovery and operational continuity.</p>
</section>

<section id="fraud" class="content-section">
  <h2>Fraud Reporting & Investigation Protocols</h2>
  <p>FRA maintains a transparent fraud reporting process. When a user submits a fraud report, it triggers an automated
    case creation process reviewed by analysts for verification. Verified cases are escalated to appropriate
    authorities or cyber investigation teams.</p>
  <p>Data related to the incident is preserved to ensure traceability and support legal proceedings. User identities
    are protected throughout the investigation.</p>
</section>

<section id="legal" class="content-section">
  <h2>Legal Disclaimer & Limitations</h2>
  <p>While FRA strives to ensure all information is accurate and secure, we make no guarantees of uninterrupted
    availability or absolute protection from external threats. By using our site, users agree that the FRA is not
    liable for incidental losses resulting from system disruptions or third-party attacks.</p>
  <p>All disputes are governed under U.S. federal law, and jurisdiction resides in the applicable district court of
    the United States.</p>
