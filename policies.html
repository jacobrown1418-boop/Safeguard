    <h1>Policies & Consumer Protections</h1>
    <p>
      At Federal Reserve Accounts, we commit to transparency, consumer rights, and regulatory compliance. 
      Below are the policies, standards, and practices that guide how we manage accounts, data, and service integrity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <main class="policies-container">
    <!-- Privacy & Data Protection -->
    <section class="policy">
      <h2>Privacy & Data Protection</h2>
      <p>
        We collect only the information necessary to provide services, such as name, contact, transaction data, 
        and verification details. We never sell or rent your personal data. Disclosure only occurs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When required by federal law, legal process, court order, or government agencies.</li>
        <li>To prevent fraud or security violations affecting accounts.</li>
        <li>When you expressly consent to a specific data share.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We use strong encryption in transit and at rest. Access controls, regular audits, and monitoring reduce risk.  
        In case of a data breach, we will notify affected users and authorities in full compliance with applicable laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also adhere to standards such as the Privacy Shield / Data Privacy Framework (for EU–U.S. data transfers).  
        :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Account Security & Fraud Protection -->
    <section class="policy">
      <h2>Account Security & Fraud Protection</h2>
      <p>
        Security is central to our operations. We maintain multi-layered systems that flag unusual behavior, require
        multi-factor authentication, and monitor transactions in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If suspicious or fraudulent activity is detected, we may suspend account access temporarily until verification
        is completed. You’ll be notified, and you retain the right to dispute actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        All account actions (logins, transfers, setting changes) are logged. For higher-risk transactions, we may
        require additional identity checks.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Consumer Rights & Transparency -->
    <section class="policy">
      <h2>Consumer Rights & Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        As a federally managed service, you have the following rights:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access to clear, readable disclosures of fees, terms, and conditions.</li>
        <li>Advance notice (when feasible) of policy changes or updates.</li>
        <li>Right to review your account statements and transaction history.</li>
        <li>Ability to dispute errors or unauthorized transactions.</li>
        <li>Right to opt out of certain data-sharing (where allowed by law).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We aim for full transparency. If we update these policies, we’ll provide notice via email or dashboard alerts ahead
        of implementation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Use of Services & Responsibilities -->
    <section class="policy">
      <h2>Use of Services & Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to use your account and our services lawfully, honestly, and in compliance with all applicable U.S.
        federal laws. You are responsible for maintaining strong passwords and safeguarding your login credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prohibited activities include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unauthorized access or sharing of your credentials.</li>
        <li>Using accounts for fraudulent or illegal actions.</li>
        <li>Attempting to manipulate or exploit system vulnerabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend or close accounts for violations or repeated abuse.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Policy & Enforcement / FTC Policy Work -->
    <section class="policy">
      <h2>Policy & Enforcement Framework</h2>
      <p>
        We model our policies on strong federal principles, similar to the FTC’s policy work which includes advocacy,
        research, public comment rules, and issuing reports. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of FTC policy functions include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Filing “amicus briefs” to inform court decisions.</li>
        <li>Publishing reports on industry practices and privacy risks. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</li>
        <li>Soliciting public comments when creating new rules. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</li>
        <li>Advisory opinions and policy statements to guide enforcement. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Compliance & Dispute Resolution -->
    <section class="policy">
      <h2>Compliance & Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        If you find an error or unauthorized activity, you may submit a dispute within 60 days of the statement date.  
        We’ll investigate and respond within a reasonable timeframe.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe a policy has been violated, you may file a complaint with our support or with regulatory bodies,
        such as the FTC.
