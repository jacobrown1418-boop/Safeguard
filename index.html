    <h3>About the Federal Reserve Accounts</h3>
    <p>
      Federal Reserve Accounts are created to ensure that the American people
      have access to accounts that are fully protected by the U.S. Treasury
      Department. Unlike traditional banking accounts, these accounts are
      monitored, regulated, and supported by federal oversight.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Our accounts serve as a cornerstone of financial security, offering
      transparency, stability, and reliability. They reflect the commitment of
      the federal government to safeguard consumer finances while reinforcing
      economic resilience.

  <section class="content-section">
    <h3>Security You Can Trust</h3>
    <p>
      Security is at the heart of every Federal Reserve Account. Each account
      is protected by layers of federal-grade security protocols, ensuring
      your funds are never at risk from unauthorized access or fraudulent
      activities.  
    </p>
    <p>
      With monitoring systems that work 24/7, your accounts remain safe under
      constant watch. Multi-layer authentication and data encryption are built
      into the infrastructure. Additionally, the full backing of the
      <strong>U.S. Treasury Department</strong> means that your account has
      the ultimate guarantee — support and protection from the federal
      government itself.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you are managing savings, checking, or business accounts, our
      promise is to provide security that adapts to the evolving digital
      landscape. Federal Reserve Accounts go beyond traditional banking by
      delivering unmatched levels of trust and assurance.
