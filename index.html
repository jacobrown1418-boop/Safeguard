        <h2>Identity Theft Protection</h2>
        <p>
          Identity theft is one of the fastest-growing crimes in the United States, 
          costing consumers billions of dollars every year. Criminals can use stolen 
          personal information to open fraudulent accounts, access your finances, or 
          damage your credit history.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Safeguard Accounts, we take proactive measures to help protect you from 
          identity theft. Our security features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>🔒 Continuous monitoring for unusual account activity</li>
          <li>🔒 Alerts and notifications when suspicious transactions occur</li>
          <li>🔒 Strong password enforcement and two-factor authentication</li>
          <li>🔒 Identity recovery assistance in case of fraud</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you believe you are a victim of identity theft, we provide tools and 
          resources to help you report the incident, recover your accounts, and 
          protect your identity moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our specialists work with federal consumer protection agencies to make 
          sure your case is handled quickly and effectively. Every report of identity 
          theft is taken seriously, and our response team is available 24/7 to provide support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Victims of identity theft often face long-term challenges such as damaged 
          credit scores, denied loans, or harassment from debt collectors. Safeguard Accounts 
          assists you through the recovery process, helping restore your financial reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Education is also part of protection. We regularly share guidance on how to 
          recognize phishing scams, avoid unsafe websites, and protect sensitive 
          personal documents from being stolen.
        </p>
        <p>
          By combining advanced security systems with consumer awareness programs, 
          we work to reduce the risk of identity theft before it happens. Prevention 
          is always better than cure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Safeguard Accounts also provides free annual security reviews so you can 
          assess the strength of your account protections and make adjustments as needed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember: protecting your identity is not just our responsibility — it’s a 
          shared effort. Together, we can keep your financial life safe and secure.
