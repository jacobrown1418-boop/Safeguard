        Federal Reserve Accounts are protected by industry-leading encryption,
        enforced access controls, and continuous monitoring. The U.S. Treasury
        Department provides institutional backing and oversight for the program,
        ensuring that security standards are aligned with federal guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use multi-factor authentication, behavior-based fraud detection,
        and anomaly alerts to stop suspicious transactions before they become
        problems. Our data centers are hosted within secure US-based facilities
        with strict physical and network security controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every transaction is logged and audited‚Äîthis helps with fast forensic
        investigations if an incident occurs. Additionally, independent compliance
        reviews and third-party audits occur regularly to validate controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Account recovery includes step-by-step support from our specialists,
        identity restoration services, and partners that help repair credit when
        fraud occurs. Users receive clear guidance about steps to take and how
        we coordinate with federal agencies on their behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your privacy is a priority. We collect only necessary data, limit access,
        and follow strict retention rules. Data transfers (if any) comply with
        U.S. federal requirements and are documented for transparency.

    <!-- About FTC (expanded) -->
    <section id="about-ftc" class="about-ftc">
      <h2>About the FTC</h2>
      <p>
        The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces consumer protection laws,
        investigates unfair business practices, and educates Americans about
        financial scams and consumer rights. The FTC works across the federal
        government to ensure markets remain competitive and consumers are not
        misled or defrauded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The FTC handles complaints, conducts investigations, and when necessary,
        pursues enforcement actions to stop deceptive business behavior. They
        also provide resources to help victims of identity theft and financial
        fraud recover.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Commission publishes guidance, policy statements, and educational
        resources designed to help consumers spot scams, secure their accounts,
        and understand legal protections available to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The FTC collaborates with law enforcement partners, state regulators,
        and industry groups to develop best practices and improve consumer
        protections nationwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there are systemic issues observed across many consumers‚Äîlike a large
        scale data breach or a deceptive practice‚Äîthe FTC can pursue broad
        corrective actions and restitution for affected individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The FTC is a resource for both individuals and organizations seeking to
        understand compliance responsibilities and how to protect consumers in
        the digital economy.
